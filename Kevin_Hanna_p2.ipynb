    "In this project, you'll work with text data from newsgroup postings on a variety of topics. You'll train classifiers to distinguish between the topics based on the text of the posts. Whereas with digit classification, the input is relatively dense: a 28x28 matrix of pixels, many of which are non-zero, here we'll represent each document with a \"bag-of-words\" model. As you'll see, this makes the feature representation quite sparse -- only a few words of the total vocabulary are active in any given document. The bag-of-words assumption here is that the label depends only on the words; their order is not important.\n",

    "ANSWER:\n",
    "\n",
    "a) Why doesn't nearest neighbors work well for this problem?  \n",
    "\n",
    "There are several reasons KNN doesn't work well for this problem:\n",
    "* There are a lot more words that are going to be common under any topic.  Additionaly, there are two topics with similar subjects, atheism and religion, so those are likely going to viewed as similar even without other problems inherent with knn in this type of problem.\n",
    "* The fequency of the word changes the distance which isn't desired, especially when the length of the text isn't being considered where a frequency of 0 is closer to 5 than 12.  So not using a word unique to the topic can often score higher than using it a lot. \n",
    "* The order in which words are used is important, and knn doesn't pay any attention to the order.\n",
    "* It should be noted that adding stop words and other treatments in the vectorization process could improve results.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "b) Any ideas why logistic regression doesn't work as well as Naive Bayes?  \n",
    "\n",
    "Naive Bayes uses conditional probabilities which in this case will likely help some since language only has meaning with context of the words around it.  Order and proximity are also critical to understanding speach, and none of these models take those in to consideration. \n",
    "\n",
    "c) Logistic regression estimates a weight vector for each class, which you can access with the coef_ attribute. Output the sum of the squared weight values for each class for each setting of the C parameter. Briefly explain the relationship between the sum and the value of C.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The sum of the squared coeffecients increase as C is increased.  Negative coeffecients become more decrease and positive increase.  C is the \"Inverse of regularization strength\", thus, the lower it is the closer the distribution is to being uniform, which means the features have less predictive power. Without the regularization the probability distribution is \n"

    "(5) Try to improve the logistic regression classifier by passing a custom preprocessor to CountVectorizer. The preprocessing function runs on the raw text, before it is split into words by the tokenizer. Your preprocessor should try to normalize the input in various ways to improve generalization. For example, try lowercasing everything, replacing sequences of numbers with a single token, removing various other non-letter characters, and shortening long words. If you're not already familiar with regular expressions for manipulating strings, see https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html, and re.sub() in particular. With your new preprocessor, how much did you reduce the size of the dictionary?\n",

    "(6) The idea of regularization is to avoid learning very large weights (which are likely to fit the training data, but not generalize well) by adding a penalty to the total size of the learned weights. That is, logistic regression seeks the set of weights that minimizes errors in the training data AND has a small size. The default regularization, L2, computes this size as the sum of the squared weights (see P3, above). L1 regularization computes this size as the sum of the absolute values of the weights. The result is that whereas L2 regularization makes all the weights relatively small, L1 regularization drives lots of the weights to 0, effectively removing unimportant features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Train a logistic regression model using a \"l1\" penalty. Output the number of learned weights that are not equal to zero. How does this compare to the number of non-zero weights you get with \"l2\"? Now, reduce the size of the vocabulary by keeping only those features that have at least one non-zero weight and retrain a model using \"l2\".\n",
